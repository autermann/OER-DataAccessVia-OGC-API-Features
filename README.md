# OER Data Access via the OGC API Features Interface

This repository contains the tutorial “Data Access via OGC API Features” which is available for reuse as an Open Educational Resource (OER). 

In this tutorial you will learn how to access geospatial data using web services that implement the OGC API Features interface. 
-	You will use docker images to install and run an OGC API Features server on your local computer providing data on nature reserves
-	You will learn how to interact with this service instance in various ways: a) with a browser b) with QGIS c) with Python from a Jupyter notebook

The tutorial is structured as follows: 
-	Overview 
-	Background
    - Feature Data and Feature Services
    - Advantages of accessing data with OGC Web Services
    - OGC-API series of interface specifications
    - OGC-API Features interface
-	Practical exercises
    - Use cases and technical setting
    - Installing software and data
    - Using the web browser to interact with the OGC-API Features service
    - Using QGIS to access feature data via the OGC API Features interface
    - Using Python to interact with the OGC-API Features service
-	Summary and Discussion

### Target Audience and Prerequisites

This tutorial is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their understanding of Spatial Information Infrastructures. We assume that you have some basic knowledge about geospatial data, QGIS and Python. In this case you will need about 90 minutes to use this tutorial.
It would be great if you also had some experience with Docker and Jupyter Notebooks. However, the OER will guide you through all of these technologies and can also be used to gain initial hands-on experience with them.

### How to use the OER Module

The OER is implemented as an [H5P](https://h5p.org/) module that can be downloaded and embedded into any H5P runtime environment, such as:
- Learning management systems based on Moodle or Ilias
- H5P editing environments such as the [H5P Official Editor](https://h5p.org/) or the lightweight [LUMI H5P editor](https://lumi.education/)
- Content managament systems such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) with "H5P" plugin installed

Simply download just the H5P file, upload it to one of the environments and use it from there...

Alternatively you can use the Document "OER-DataAccessVia-OGC-API-Features.pdf" from the PDF folder which has the same content.
